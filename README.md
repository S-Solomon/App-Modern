# APP MODERN

## Tech Stack:

* React Js
* Typescript
* Styled Components
* React Testing Library


I chose typescript because i wanted a challenge and i would like to improve
my typescript skill set, styled-components beacuse i love it and react testing
library because it comes shipped with create-react-app.


## Approach
I went with the mobile first approach when building this project. The figma file 
came only with the desktop version , so i had to make the mobile version myself.


## Improvements
I hard coded some things like the title and subtitle, i could have easily 
made them into a component because it is repeated throught the page. I 
also could have written more tests for the other components.
