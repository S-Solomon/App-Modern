# APP MODERN

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tech Stack:
* React Js
* Typescript
* Styled Components
* React Testing Library


I initially didn't want to use typescript, but i thought it would be challenging, so i went ahead with typescript.


### `Approach`
I went with the mobile first approach when building this project. The figma file file come only with the
desktop version , so i had to make the mobile version myself.


### `Improvements`
I probably hard coded some things like the title and subtitle, i could have easily made them into a component.
I also could have written more tests for the other components.
